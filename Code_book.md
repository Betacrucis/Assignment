# Assignment

This is the assessment for the Coursera course Getting and Cleaning Data.

The file with the code to complete the tasks is called run_analysis.R

The merged data is put in to anew folder under "UCI HAR Dataset"

The steps are described in the file with comments.

The Data Book is from the dataset itself - features_info.txt and the original readme.txt
